# ZENPAY
How It Works
ZenPAY operates by allowing users to perform transactions through a secure and responsive interface. The application connects to a dummy bank webhook server to simulate real-world financial transactions and verify the correctness of the transaction process. WebSockets are used to provide real-time updates on transaction statuses, ensuring users are always informed of the latest developments.

Challenges Faced & Solutions
1. Transaction Processing
Implementing a secure and reliable transaction processing system posed several challenges, including handling concurrent transactions and ensuring data integrity.

Problem: Managing concurrent transactions and ensuring that each transaction is processed accurately.

Solution: Implemented robust transaction handling mechanisms and used PostgreSQL's transaction features to maintain data integrity.

2. Real-Time Updates
Providing real-time updates for transactions required efficient WebSocket management and synchronization.

Problem: Ensuring that WebSocket connections remained stable and that updates were delivered in a timely manner.

Solution: Optimized WebSocket configurations and implemented error-handling mechanisms to maintain stable connections and reliable updates.

3. Dummy Bank Webhook Integration
Setting up a dummy bank webhook server for testing purposes was crucial but challenging to simulate realistic banking scenarios.

Problem: Creating a webhook server that accurately simulates a real bank's responses and processes.

Solution: Developed a mock webhook server using Express.js to simulate various banking responses and transaction processes for comprehensive testing.

Future Enhancements
Payment Gateway Integration: Implement integration with real payment gateways to support actual financial transactions.
Advanced Security Features: Enhance security with additional features such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and fraud detection.
Mobile Optimization: Improve the user experience on mobile devices with additional responsive design tweaks.
Analytics Dashboard: Add a dashboard for users to view detailed transaction analytics and reports.
